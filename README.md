# powershell-poc

This is a proof of concept on how you can develop, build, and package PowerShell projects within GitHub leverage [GitHub flow and techniques][github-services-workflow-guide] and [Azure DevOps Artifacts][azure-devops-artifacts].

## Prerequisites

- [PowerShell 7][powershell-install]
- [dotnet 2.0 or newer][dotnet-install]
- [Azure DevOps account][azure-devops]

For local development or execution on remote machines, these will have to be installed and maintained through your preferred processes.

For continuous integration, these should be pre-installed in various GitHub Actions virtual environments:
  - [`ubuntu-18.04`][actions-virtual-environment-ubuntu-1804]
  - [`ubuntu-20.04`][actions-virtual-environment-ubuntu-2004]
  - [`windows-2016`][actions-virtual-environment-windows-2016]
  - [`windows-2019`][actions-virtual-environment-windows-2019]
  - [`windows-2022`][actions-virtual-environment-windows-2022]

   <details>
     <summary>Azure Artifact feeds support both NuGet v2 and v3 APIs</summary>

     Replacing `/v3/index.json` with `/v2/` should allow this feed to be used by PowerShellGet.

1. Create GitHub Actions secret with Azure DevOps Artifacts PAT

## Why recommend Azure DevOps Artifacts?

As of October 2021, the [PowerShellGet 3.0 beta with NuGet v3 support][powershellget-nuget-support] has a couple of known issues using [NuGet-based GitHub Packages][packages-nuget] as a PowerShell repository:

- https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShellGet/issues/163
- https://github.com/OneGet/oneget/issues/430

This has forced people to work outside of [best practices in publishing PowerShell packages][powershellgallery-publishing-guidelines] of using PowerShellGet to interact with repositories:

- [GitHub Packages: Private NuGet Packages via GitHub Actions][example-dotnet]
- [Example script for publishing a PowerShell module to the NuGet GitHub Package Registry][example-powershellget-01]
- [How To Setup A Github Actions Pipeline For Publishing Your Powershell Module (to PowerShell Gallery)][example-powershellget-02]
- [Consuming a NuGet package from GitHub Packages][example-nuget-samsmithnz]

### PowerShell repository structure

In figuring out how to structure repositories for modules, scripts, and packages, I found several articles that were really well written and provided opinionated, concrete approaches:

- [Invoke-Automation "PowerShell Scaffolding â€“ How I build modules"][building-modules-invokeautomation]
- [PowerShell Explained "Powershell: Adventures in Plaster"][building-modules-powershellexplained]
- [Rambling Cookie Monster "Building a PowerShell Module"][building-modules-ramblingcookiemonster]
